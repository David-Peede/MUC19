caption={\textbf{Table S57. Summary of SNPs segregating at high frequency in MXL across 10,000 simulated replicates.} \newline The total number of SNPs, the number of SNPs segregating a frequency greater than or equal to 30\%, and the associated \textit{P-value} based on 10,000 replicates per simulation model. The \textit{P-value} represents the proportion of SNPs across all 10,000 simulations that are segregating at a frequency greater than or equal to 30\%, where a \textit{P-value} less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant. We report the results for all SNPs, as well as archaic SNPs.},
