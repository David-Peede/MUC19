caption={\textbf{Table S60. Comparison of the number of SNPs segregating at high frequency in MXL for the observed focal regions and across 10,000 simulated replicates.} \newline The number of SNPs segregating a frequency greater than or equal to 30\% observed in MXL, along with the number of simulated replicates where the number SNPs segregating a frequency greater than or equal to 30\% is greater than or equal to what is observed in the empirical data. The \textit{P-value} represents the proportion of the 10,000 simulation replicates where the simulated value is greater than or equal to what is observed in the empirical data, where a \textit{P-value} less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant. We report the results for both the focal 742kb and 72kb \textit{MUC19} regions, for all SNPs, as well as archaic SNPs.},
