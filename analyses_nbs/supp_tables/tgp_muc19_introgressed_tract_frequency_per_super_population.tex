caption={\textbf{Table S1. Frequency of introgressed tracts overlapping \textit{MUC19} among 1000 Genomes Project super populations.} \newline The frequency of introgressed tracts---i.e., the number of introgressed tracts normalized by the total number of chromosomes---and the mean tract length stratified by super population: Admixed Americans (AMR), South Asians (SAS), East Asians (EAS), Europeans (EUR), and Africans (AFR). Introgressed tracts at \textit{MUC19} are significantly enriched in AMR individuals (Fisher's Exact Test, Odds Ratio: 2.354, \textit{P-value}: $2.144e^{-12}$), with AMR populations exhibiting a higher proportion of introgressed tracts compared to non-AMR populations, excluding AFR (Proportions \textit{Z}-Test, \textit{Z}-statistic: 7.441, \textit{P-value}: $5.011e^{-14}$).  Note that a "---" denotes that there are no introgressed tracts overlapping \textit{MUC19} for that group.},
