## Overview

- `data`
  - _MUC19_ annotation inputs for `SLiM`.
- `output`
  - Output files from `SLiM` where `snegative` represents simulations using the demographic model described in [Medina-Mu√±oz et. al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.06.531060) and `vnegative` represents simulations using the demographic model described in Figure S21.
- `scripts`
  - The code used to run the simulations.
  - A walkthrough of the pipeline can be found at `./scripts/sim_pipeline.ipynb`
