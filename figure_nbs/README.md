# `figure_nbs`

This directory contains the code to replicate the main figures from this study.

## Packages

All packages are publicly available and their documentation can be viewed at the following places:

- [`matpltlib v3.5.2`](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [`NumPy v1.22.3`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html)
- [`pandas v1.4.2`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- [`scikit-allel v1.3.5`](https://scikit-allel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)

## Code

__Create the `data` directory since GitHub only allows for 100Mb of storage. Note that all the data necessary to replicate the figures can be found in the de-compressed `data` directory without the need to run any other code.__
```bash
tar -xf data.tar.gz
```
