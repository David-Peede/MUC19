### Notes

As this code is associated with a manuscript that is currently going through the peer-review process and due to the fact that GitHub only stores up to 100 Mb per repository some directories are compressed using `.tar.gz` or `.zip`. To extract the files those directories you will need to run either `tar -xf target_directory.tar.gz` or `unzip target_directory.zip`. Once the associated manuscript has been peer-reviewed all output files will be uploaded to the appropriate locations.
